Stack.h provides a template class with pure virtual functions to ensure the implementation of basic functionalities required for the stack.

Arr.cpp is an array based implementation of the stack. As we are familiar with array, it is more convenient to work with the array based implementation.

LL.cpp is a linked stack. Although it is a relatively new concept, some operations are less costly here than array based stack.

dwAB.cpp and dwC.cpp use either the Arr.cpp or LL.cpp to simulate a dishwasher, using the functionalities of those files.
