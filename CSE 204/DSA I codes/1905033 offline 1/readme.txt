List.h provides a template class with pure virtual functions to ensure the implementation of basic functionalities required for the list.

Arr.cpp is an array based implementation of the list. As we are familiar with array, it is more convenient to work with the array based implementation.

LL.cpp is a linked list. Although it is a relatively new concept, some operations are less costly here than array based list.

TNL.cpp uses either the Arr.cpp or LL.cpp to implement a transit network line, using the functionalities of those files.
