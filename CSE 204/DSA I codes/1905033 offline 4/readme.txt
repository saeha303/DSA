Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

-The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
-The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
-The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

BST.cpp is an implementation of the binary search tree with 4 methods in it: Insert, Find, Traverse and Delete. After every insertion or deletion operation, the tree is printed specifying the left and right children's in nested parentheses format. All 3 kinds of traversal are implemented.
